            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            S2 is a dota player originally from Nepal. Currently living and studying in Philadelpia, Penselvenia. Known for his amazing meepo plays and high death and kill count, he has been playing the game for almost a decade. He enjoys watching Rick and Morty and has even set his Steam profile picture to a fan art of the show.
            When playing he is rarely found communicating through voice chat, but in rare occasion that he does use voice chat, he is seen chanting "Hero Alom!" as if he is a part of a deranged cult.

        <h2>
            Teenage years
        </h2>
            S2 spend his teenage years honing the skills of his fingers in both writing of code and playing the guitar, and to this day remains avid coder and an amatuer guitar player. His teenage life was simple study, play guitar, play Dota, watch anime, and code. A small window to his childhood could be seen through is past Facebook post, with him sharing shitty memes of popular animes such as Naruto and Pokemon and his guitar covers.  
        <h2>
            Entry to DOTA 2
        </h2>
        <p>
            S2 started his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena"> Online Battle Arena(MOBA)</a> with League of Legends. Playing on South East Asian server. Due to his naive and immensely toxic behaviour he was swiftly banned. Thus was his introduction to Defence of the Ancients or DOTA, a custom map for WarcraftIII: Reign of Chaos expansion The Frozen Throne. His fascination with this game led to him spending hundreds of hours honing and perfecting his skills aiming to beat anyone who was unlucky enough to face him.
