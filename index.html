        S2 is a dota player originally from Nepal. Currently living and studying in Philadelpia, Penselvenia. Known for his amazing meepo plays and high death and kill count, he has been playing the game for almost a decade. He enjoys watching Rick and Morty
        and has even set his Steam profile picture to a fan art of the show. When playing he is rarely found communicating through voice chat, but in rare occasion that he does use voice chat, he is seen chanting "Hero Alom!" as if he is a part of a deranged
        cult.

        S2 spend his teenage years honing the skills of his fingers sin both writing of code and playing the guitar, and to this day remains avid coder and an amatuer guitar player. His teenage life was simple study, play guitar, play Dota, watch anime, and code.
        A small window to his childhood could be seen through is past Facebook post, with him sharing shitty memes of popular animes such as Naruto and Pokemon and his guitar covers.

        S2 started his <a class="inbody" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena" target="_blank">Multiplayer  Online Battle Arena(MOBA)</a> with League of Legends. Playing on South East Asian server. Due to his naive and immensely
        toxic behaviour he was swiftly banned. Thus was his introduction to Defence of the Ancients or DOTA, a custom map for WarcraftIII: Reign of Chaos expansion The Frozen Throne. His fascination with this game led to him spending hundreds of hours
        honing and perfecting his skills aiming to beat anyone who was unlucky enough to face him.

        play all the heroes with amazing skill, he is well known for his plays as Meepo, considered to be the hardest Hero to play in the game, and Mirana, a hero who is fairly easy to play but has a very high skill cap. He is in the top 1000 players
        of Meepo in the world. His current rank is Ancient III with Match Making ranking over 4000, and has played over 2700 games.

        In order to share his great DOTA 2 plays live, he decided to start a short career in Twitch streaming. Under a assumed dame of "pix3l3", and ode to his favourite android phone made by Google, Google Pixel 3, he started to show people how to destroy opponents
        in DOTA 2. Unlike the popular streamers nowadays, his stream was solely centered around his mesmerizing plays with no interaction with any people watching or his opponents or even his teammates. Though shortlived, his career in streaming influenced
        hundreds of people throughout the world to get better at DOTA 2. Remnants of his stream can be found at <a class="inbody" href="https://www.twitch.tv/pix3l3/videos">Twitch</a> with people still visiting the site in hopes of getting a glimpse
        of him playing.

        The most interesting aspect of S2, from a Player's perspective, is his ability to play the team game as if it was a single player game, with not communication or interaction with his team, not playing a part of the team, but still getting numerous kills
        and getting the game objectives. His playstyle of high risk high reward has a polarizing effect on all people who play with him, either regarding him as a great player or a person with inadequate brain cells. This effect is not limited to his
        teammates, even enemy players could be seen visibly effected enraging them, or calming them. The most infamous of these plays is buying the most expensive item in the game, <a class="inbody" href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Divine_Rapier">the Divine Rapier</a>,
        that drops on death and then getting himself killed like he has never played the game in his entire life.
